    <h2>❓ Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>1. How do I book a tour?</h3>
      <p>You can book directly through our website or via our booking partners. Just pick your tour, choose a date, and we’ll take care of the rest (no spell required).</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>2. Are the tours private or group-based?</h3>
      <p>All tours are private by default — it’s just you (and your chosen companions) with a dedicated guide. Want to bring a few friends? Great. Want it to be just the two of you? Even better.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>3. What’s included in the tour price?</h3>
      <p>Each tour includes your private guide, customized storytelling, and plenty of insider knowledge. Some tours (like our foodie tour) also include tastings, which we’ll mention in the description.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>4. How much walking is involved?</h3>
      <p>All tours are walking-based and cover about 1.5 to 3 hours of leisurely strolling with stops. Wear comfy shoes and dress for the weather — London is charmingly unpredictable.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>5. Are the tours suitable for kids?</h3>
      <p>Yes! Most of our tours are family-friendly, especially the Harry Potter and London Highlights tours. For younger guests, we tweak the pace and stories. The Jack the Ripper tour is better suited to ages 14+ due to mature content.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>6. Can you adapt the tour to my interests?</h3>
      <p>Absolutely. These tours are flexible — want more history? Less walking? A coffee stop mid-tour? Just let us know when you book, and we’ll tailor the experience.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>7. What happens if it rains?</h3>
      <p>It’s London — rain is part of the magic. Tours run in all weather, but we’ll keep things cozy and adjust the route if needed. Bring an umbrella and a sense of adventure!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>8. Can I cancel or reschedule?</h3>
      <p>Yes. We offer free rescheduling or cancellation up to 48 hours before the tour. Life happens — just give us a heads-up and we’ll make it work.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>9. Where do the tours start and end?</h3>
      <p>Each tour has a central London meeting point (we’ll send exact details after booking). Ending locations vary slightly but are always in accessible areas with nearby transport links.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>10. Do you offer gift cards or custom experiences?</h3>
      <p>We sure do. Whether it’s a birthday surprise, corporate treat, or anniversary adventure, we can create a custom tour or voucher that suits your needs. Just drop us a message.</p>
