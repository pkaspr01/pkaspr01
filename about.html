        <h3>Meet Ra√∫l ‚Äì Foodie, Football Fan & Architecture Buff</h3>
        <p>Originally from Spain, Ra√∫l moved to London six years ago to study architecture ‚Äî and never looked back. What started as a part-time job to support his studies soon turned into a real passion: leading walking tours and helping people see London through a different lens.
Ra√∫l knows the city inside out, especially when it comes to great food. From hidden tapas joints to the best spots for global cuisine, he‚Äôs always got a recommendation up his sleeve ‚Äî don‚Äôt forget to ask him where to eat after your tour!
He speaks Spanish and English fluently, and with his background in architecture, Ra√∫l brings a unique layer to each walk. Expect thoughtful insights into London‚Äôs buildings, old and new, and the stories behind the city's evolving skyline.
Warm, curious, and always up for a chat about football or food ‚Äî Ra√∫l will make sure your tour is both fun and full of discoveries.</p>
