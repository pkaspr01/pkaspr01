        <h3>Meet Ra√∫l ‚Äì Foodie, Football Fan & Architecture Buff</h3>
        <p>Originally from Spain, Ra√∫l moved to London six years ago to study architecture ‚Äî and never looked back. What started as a part-time job to support his studies soon turned into a real passion: leading walking tours and helping people see London through a different lens.</p>
        <p>Ra√∫l knows the city inside out, especially when it comes to great food. From hidden tapas joints to the best spots for global cuisine, he‚Äôs always got a recommendation up his sleeve ‚Äî don‚Äôt forget to ask him where to eat after your tour!</p>
        <p>He speaks Spanish and English fluently, and with his background in architecture, Ra√∫l brings a unique layer to each walk. Expect thoughtful insights into London‚Äôs buildings, old and new, and the stories behind the city's evolving skyline.</p>
        <p>Warm, curious, and always up for a chat about football or food ‚Äî Ra√∫l will make sure your tour is both fun and full of discoveries.</p>

        <p>With a degree in History and a special passion for Ancient Rome, she originally moved to London to work as a teacher. Now, she combines her love of storytelling with guiding ‚Äî helping visitors connect the dots between Roman London and the eternal city.</p>
        <p>But don‚Äôt let the academic side fool you ‚Äî Giorgia is also obsessed with true crime podcasts, making her the perfect host for our Jack the Ripper tour. She‚Äôll have you hanging on every word as she takes you through London‚Äôs darker past.</p>
