        Welcome to your new favourite way to explore London.<br />
        We’re a small team of passionate, local guides who believe the best parts of a city are often the ones hidden from the crowds. Our walking tours are designed for curious souls who want to see more than just the typical sights — whether it’s a street art alley you’d never find alone, a quirky vintage market, or the forgotten stories that shaped this incredible city.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each of our guides brings their own personality, language, and special interests — so you can choose the experience (and person) that feels right for you.
      </p>
      <p>
        We keep things friendly, flexible, and personal. No giant umbrellas, no boring scripts — just real London, shared with heart.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pick your guide. Choose your adventure.<br />
        And let the city surprise you.

      <div class="testimonial">
        <p><strong>We were in London for a design conference and decided to organise a private tour for our team. The experience was incredibly well curated — our guide tailored the route to focus on London’s architecture, urban design, and the evolution of the city. It was both fun and inspiring, and gave our international team a deeper appreciation of the city. Highly recommended for any creative professionals visiting London!</strong></p>

        <p><strong>We had a mixed group and a few special requests but that wasn’t an issue. They really helped us craft the perfect tour and all went smoothly! </strong></p>

        <p><strong>The vintage market tour was such a fun and unique experience! Giorgia knows exactly where to go for the best market stalls and we were able to find a few great pieces to add to our wardrobe! I will definitely be back with a larger suitcase!!</strong></p>
